Hephaestos is a simple, automated file downloader that frees you from the burden of clickety-clacking through thousands of links in your browser like some dirty peon when you want to peruse last year's issues of your favorite webcomic or the 3576 new erotic Harry Potter stories added during the last 2 hours on fanfiction.net. These, after all, are precisely the menial and repetitive tasks computers were made to automatize and which browsers, miraculously, have managed to turn into manual labour again.

Well, fear not! Just put in a URL or the name of your favorite site, press Enter, and watch as 5GB of your favourite garbage gets downloaded onto your hard drive!*
