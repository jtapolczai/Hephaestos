             A &lambda; crawler</h3>

<p>Welcome, good visitor! You find yourself on the page of <em>Hephaestos</em>. Hephaestos is a crawler library/client with which can perform a variety of tasks, such as:
   <ul>
      <li>download entire sites,</li>
      <li>download all images/links on a site,</li>
      <li>download webcomics,</li>
      <li>download YouTube videos (shhhh!)</li>
      <li>run your own crawler</li>
   </ul>

The program is basically a library, intended for programmers, but it also includes a CLI for easy use. That's enough chit-chat.</p>

<h3><a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Hephaestos is a crawler-writing framework that comes with a couple of default crawlers. A crawler, for our purposes, is a function that takes a website and generates a bunch of results, together with URLs that should also be crawled. Once you have that, Hephaestos takes care of everything else: saving, error-reporting, re-trying, post-processing. While you can just mirror an entire website in this way, it is also possible to just download, say, a series of images, text, XML, or videos from it.</p>

<p>An example, in the CLI:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./Hephaestos
> :crawler pennyArcade
> Enter direction (Forward/Backward): Backward
> Enter number of items: 10
...
Job done!
</code></pre>

<p>And thus, the last ten issues of the Penny Arace webcomic have been downloaded. A second, site-generic example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./Hephaestos
> :crawler allImages
> Enter URL: http://www.domain.com/kittenPictures
...
Job done!
</code></pre>

<p>This series of commands downloads all linked images from the fictional <code>http://www.domain.com/kittenPictures</code>.</p>

<h3><a id="how-complicated" class="anchor" href="#how-complicated" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How complicated is it to use?</h3>

<p>I am a very, very lazy many and thus, you can rest assured that this tool is optimized for the absolute minimum of user effort.</p>

<h3><a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements &amp; Installation</h3>

You will need Haskell (GHC version 7.6 or newer recommended). The platform can be gotten from <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">https://www.haskell.org/platform/</a>. Once it is installed, type the following:

<pre><code>$ cd directory_into_which_you_extracted_hephaestos
$ cabal install hephaestos.cabal
$ runhaskell Setup.hs install
</code></pre>

<p>This installs the library and creates the executable (called <code>Hephaestos</code>).</p>
